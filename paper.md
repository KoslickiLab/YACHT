# Summary

# Statement of need

Motivation: In metagenomics, the study of environmentally associated microbial communities from their sampled DNA, one of the most fundamental computational tasks is that of determining which genomes from a reference database are present or absent in a given sample metagenome. Existing tools generally return point estimates, with no associated confidence or uncertainty associated with it. This has led to practitioners experiencing difficulty when interpreting the results from these tools, particularly for low abundance organisms as these often reside in the “noisy tail” of incorrect predictions. Furthermore, few tools account for the fact that reference databases are often incomplete and rarely, if ever, contain exact
replicas of genomes present in an environmentally derived metagenome. 

Results: We present solutions for these issues by introducing the algorithm YACHT: Yes/No Answers to Community membership via Hypothesis Testing. This approach introduces a statistical framework that accounts for sequence divergence between the reference and sample genomes, in terms of average nucleotide identity (ANI), as well as incomplete sequencing depth, thus providing a hypothesis test for determining the presence or absence of a reference genome in a sample. After introducing our approach, we quantify its statistical power and how this changes with varying parameters. Subsequently, we perform extensive experiments using both simulated and real data to confirm the accuracy and scalability of this approach


# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
