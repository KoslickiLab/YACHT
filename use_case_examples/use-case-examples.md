## Contamination Detection

Identifying contamination of samples is an important step for downstream analysis. 

Failure to detect sample contaminants can bias community diversity and strain sharing identification, which lead to false claims in research. Additionally, contaminant detection is a challenge for low-biomass data.

There are two types of contaminants that yacht can detect. Specifically, external and cross contaminations. External contaminations includes any microbial DNA that can come from a researcher's native microbiome, experimental kits, and surrounding areas. Cross contamination can come from DNA extractions, sequencing index switching, and sample bleeding. Further, cross-contamination can complicate contimanation detection

Why is this important?

### External Contamination Detection Example

Example:

### Cross Contamination Detection Example
