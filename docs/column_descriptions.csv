num_total_kmers_in_genome_sketch,Total number of k-mers in genome sketch
scale_factor,Scale factor
num_exclusive_kmers_in_sample_sketch,Count of distinct k-mers in sketched sample
num_total_kmers_in_sample_sketch,Total number of k-mers in sample sketch
min_coverage,Minimum coverage parameter
in_sample_est,Boolean indicating whether genome is present in sample
p_vals,The probability of observing this many or fewer k-mer matches under the null assumption that the reference organism is present in the sample (within the ANI and coverage thresholds)
num_exclusive_kmers_to_genome,Number of k-mers that are exclusive to genome
num_exclusive_kmers_to_genome_coverage,"Number of k-mers exclusive to genome, multiplied by min_coverage parameter"
num_matches,Size of intersection between exclusive k-mers and sample

actual_confidence_with_coverage,Actual confidence adjusted for coverage
alt_confidence_mut_rate_wo_coverage,"Mutation rate such that at this mutation rate, false positive rate = p_val. Does not account for min_coverage parameter."
alt_confidence_mut_rate_with_coverage,"Mutation rate such that at this mutation rate, false positive rate = p_val, accounting for min_coverage parameter."
